                            </header>
                            <p> steam just downloaded 100 MB worth of stuff but I cant find any official patch notes from steam discussion forums "Nukleon 1 hour ago Two videos were changed, the Sectoid Commander interrogation, and a chinese legal notice. Then a bunch of engine related files were also updated, the biggest being shader files for the games Unreal Engine 3." Also shows that they uploaded linux versions of XCOM probably for the SteamOS release. A Look Forwards (An Introduction To Annette) . A glimpse into the future, a look into the past. // On a bright summer's day in 2038, Jane Kelly says a pair of words that change your life. "I'm pregnant." Generally speaking, it's no real surprise that your wife has the subtlety skills of an elephant doing dubstep, but you would've appreciated maybe just a little heads-up prior to that statement. As it is, you drop the dish you're washing, and only a hasty burst of psionics With as buggy as the current game is and as open the game is for modding, why hasn't anyone made an attempt at an unofficial patch? I see tons of bug fixing mods, though a lot of them are questionable if they fixed anything or if they are still needed or not. It just seems so weird to not have these seemingly obvious mods being worked. 
I just had a 113.3MB patch download for XCOM 2 and I can't find any information about what that is. I have confirmed it isn't any of my mods, but there is no news and no patch notes that I can find. I just played the game yesterday so it was up to date until just this evening. Anyone I finished this game and now I want more! Tried Xcom2 but I just hate it. Little story and ridiculously difficult and varying combat with minimal skills. It's been a good while since the game came out and you guys had the time to explore it deeply. Now that you explored it, what do you think of the game? What are the positives, what are the negatives? Would you recommend buying. Im expecting to see an enemy firing preview indicator akin to xcom 2 is that in the cards or been released already. Discuss June's PlayStation Plus games from a trophy perspective here. Discussion Prompts (Optional): How hard are does the platinum and/or 100% look for each title? What (if any) are you going for? Is there any title that you've already played that you recommend for or against from a trophy perspective? Bonus: How did you do with trophies for last month's PS+ games. It's now been some time since the release of Rise and Fall. First I'd like to ask what you think what date(s) it can be for the next DLC and what person/nation 
Can't seem to find a date. Last I played was March 14th and it was crashing and hanging it's ass off. Would Ps4. XCOM 2 was pretty damn buggy and unoptimized at release and the performance patch was small potatoes in terms of fixes. I feel like this game has lost a lot of momentum and the mod scene won't take off if these issues aren't fixed. I think I sent about 3 support tickets in the past few months now? Everytime it was either "clear the caches" or "if your PS4 outdated" or "re-install the game to fix it" The language often used is framed as "what's wrong with your end of things?" rather than "yeah we fucked up, we'll fix it, sorry" . To be perfectly honest, I'm pissed off at how silent the internet's been with the shitty state of the console version, especially considering how Mass Effect Andromeda was the whipping Just wondering if anybody here has got a chance to play XCOM2:WOTC with the new patch? How is the performance on X1X in terms of loading times and graphical shuttering? I like this game so much but the console version was so crappy even on X1X. I could play it on PC but still prefer to play this kind of game with a controller on couch.
